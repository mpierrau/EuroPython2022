## Fun and interesting talks

### Keynote: [Python's role in unlocking the secrets of the Universe with the James Webb Space Telescope](https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/python-s-role-in-unlocking-the-secrets-of-the-universe-with-the-james-webb-space-telescope)

Takeaway:
Holy shit, you can `pip install jwst` – the [James Webb Space Telescope analysis pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/) tool(!!!) and use the software that is used to analyze images from JWST! [JWST data](jwst-docs.stsci.edu/accessing-jwst-data) should become publicly available too soon!


### [Norvig’s lispy: beautiful and illuminating Python code](https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/norvig-s-lispy-beautiful-and-illuminating-python-code) (Luciano Ramalho) (MP)

Luciano is the author of the book Fluent Python a.k.a. “The Lizard Book”.

In this talk he dessicates Peter Norvigs re-implementation of the Scheme dialect of Lisp in 132 lines of Python code.

Check this [notebook](link) by Luciano for a fully independent walk-through of the code!

Practically I had one takeaway:
- ChainMap takes multiple dicts, in order.
- It checks for a key in the first dict, if not there it checks the second dict etc.
- I also should have learned what a _closure_ is, but it still isn’t completely clear to me.


### Using Python to predict Asset price reversals (Niall O'Connor) (MP)
… Fibonacci!!!!
